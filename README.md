# InPhoto
Tool for intelligent photogragh

### Preview
"When I'm out traveling and want to capture and share the moments, or just when I feel like expressing my mood in everyday life, snapping a photo is super handy. But here's the catch: to get a photo that really shows off my personal style and feelings, I need to know all about tweaking different settings. That's a whole lot of time and money spent on getting good at photography. Or, I could just slap on some over-the-top filter or go for a stiff, cookie-cutter AI beauty effect. So, I'm thinking, why not make a photography tool that's more me? Something where I can just say what I'm feeling or what I'm looking for, and it'll jazz up my quick pics into something that's really my own, like my personal piece of art."
